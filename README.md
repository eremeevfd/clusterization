# clusterization

Streamlit application for exploring eligibility clusters exported as CSV.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies (Streamlit and anything else required by your environment).
2. Launch the multi-page app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

3. The landing page gives context; open **Cluster Explorer** from the sidebar.
4. Upload a CSV export from the cluster visualizer on **Cluster Explorer**, then apply filters,
   download filtered results, or inspect cluster details directly from that page.
